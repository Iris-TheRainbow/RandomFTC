# RandomFTC
A HTML, CSS, and JS website that gets a random team and thier information from FTCScout.

It gets a random team by requesting it to run a best name vote, then it uses that team number to grab their team data like location, name, and rookie year. If they competed in the most recent season, it also gets their OPR information.
